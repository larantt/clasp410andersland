This is the repository for CLIMATE 410 at the University of Michigan.

It's organized into the various coding lab assignments from the class and is made avaliable for viewing of Dr. Welling and Satwika

# CLIMATE 410 LAB 1

WHAT = Learning about model universality via a probabilistic "spread model" implemented with a 2D grid and neighbor spread probabilities under the hood.

# CLIMATE 410 LAB 2

WHAT = Investigating numerical methods via executing Euler and 8th Order Runge Kutta methods and analyzing their behavior.
